Once the Outlook app is open, select a mailbox item, and you can then use the Outlook add-in. For example, you can select the option to show a task pane.

## Edit the manifest

You can find the app manifest in `./appPackage` folder. The folder contains one manifest file:

- `manifest.json`: Manifest file for Teams app running locally or running remotely (After deployed to Azure).

This file contains template arguments with `${{...}}` statements which will be replaced at build time. You may add any extra properties or permissions you require to this file. See the [schema reference](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/resources/schema/manifest-schema) for more information.
